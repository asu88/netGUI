<p> Welcome to the NetGUI page in github.</p>

<p>Teaching computer networks to freshman on its first quarter
of telecommunications engineering is a challenge due to the few, if any,
previous knowledge that must be assumed in the areas of computing and
computer networks. After evaluating existing alternatives that could be
used by the students in the practicums, we decided we had to provide
them with better tools. We have implemented a GUI named NetGUI that
allows students to design and operate computer networks emulated by
the Netkit software environment. NetGUI has been tested with 120 fresh-
man students and with a smaller group of 3rd year students with prior
knowledge in computer netwoking at two public universities in Spain.
This paper describes the tool and the experience gained in the test that
we made with the student</p>
